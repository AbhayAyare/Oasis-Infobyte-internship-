### 📧 4. Email Spam Detection
**Objective:**  
Detect whether an incoming email is **Spam** or **Ham (Not Spam)** using Machine Learning and NLP.

**Dataset:**  
[Spam Email Dataset (UCI/Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/sms-spam-collection-dataset)

**Techniques Used:**  
- Natural Language Processing (TF-IDF Vectorizer)  
- Naive Bayes, Random Forest, and SVM Classifiers  
- Text Cleaning and Preprocessing  

**Key Steps:**
1. Load dataset and clean text (remove punctuation, lowercase conversion)  
2. Convert text into numerical features using TF-IDF  
3. Train multiple models and compare accuracy  
4. Predict on new email text  

**Output Example:**
```
'Congratulations! You’ve won a free cruise!' → spam
'Hey, reminder for our meeting tomorrow.' → ham
```
